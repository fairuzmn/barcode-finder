# Barcode Finder

A flutter plugin for barcode scanner that works on both iOS and Android. Provides functionality for scanning several formats of 1D and 2D barcodes.

It uses [ML-kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) on Android and iOS to detect codes from PDF and Image files.

## Getting Started

###  Depend on it

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  barcode_finder: latest version
```
### Android Platform

API 21 is the minimum supported for Android.

## Usage

Lets take a look at how to use `BarcodeFinder` to scan any `PDF` or image `File` using [File Picker](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker) as a auxiliar plugin.

```dart
Future<String?> scanFile() async {
    // Used to pick a file from device storage
    final pickedFile = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles();
    if (pickedFile != null) {
        final filePath = pickedFile.files.single.path;
        if (filePath != null) {
            return await BarcodeFinder.scanFile(path: path);
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure you are passing a valid and permissioned path to `BarcodeFinder.scanFile`, in the exemple above, the package FilePicker provides it for us.
